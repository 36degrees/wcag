      <p>The objective of this technique is to ensure content can be scaled uniformly by using a Web technology supported by user agents that change text size via a Zoom tool.</p>
      <p>Content authored in technologies that are supported by user agents that can scale content uniformly (that is, zoom into content) satisfy this Success Criterion. Because this technique relies completely on user agent functionality, it is critical to test with a wide variety of user agents.</p>
      <p>This technique requires that all content and functionality continues to be available.</p>
      <p>This technique neither forbids nor requires the page to scroll hroizontally when the page is zoomed.</p>

         <item>
            <p>Most web browsers provide a zoom function that scales HTML/CSS page content uniformly.</p>
         </item>
         <item>
            <p>To allow users to resize text, Adobe Reader provides a magnification tool that scales PDF pages uniformly.</p>
