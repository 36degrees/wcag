      <p>This document outlines the requirements that the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (WCAG WG) has set for the development of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 extensions. These extension requirements build on the existing requirements for WCAG 2.0, and are designed to work in harmony with the WCAG 2.0 standard.</p>

      <p>
        This document is an editor's draft, getting closer to a public review draft.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) explains how to make Web content accessible to people with disabilities. Since the release of WCAG 2.0 in December 2008 WCAG 2.0 has been widely adopted and implemented. As a result of both feedback from implementers and significant changes in technologies, the WCAG WG is pursuing the development of Extension specifications and support materials to address special topic areas as needed, including (but not limited to) mobile devices, cognitive impairments and learning disabilities, and low vision.</p>
      <p>The underlying goal of each Extension is the same as for WCAG 2.0 â€“ to promote accessibility of Web content. Each Extension also needs to meet additional goals addressed in this document including:</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Satisfy pre-existing requirements for WCAG 2.0</li>
          <li>Ensure that web pages which conform to WCAG 2.0 plus an extension also conform to WCAG 2.0 on its own</li>
          <li>Ensure that all WCAG extensions are compatible with each other</li>
          <li>Define a clear conformance model for WCAG 2.0 plus extensions</li>
          <li>Ensure the conformance structure utilizes the WCAG 2.0 A/AA/AAA model</li>          
      </ol>
    </section>

        <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <section>
          <h3>Satisfy pre-existing requirements for WCAG 2.0</h3>
          <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2-req/">WCAG 2.0 Requirements document</a> provides details used during the development of WCAG 2.0, including key goals related to technology independence, clearly defined conformance requirements, and more which are still relevant and important. As with WCAG 2.0 the WCAG Extensions will provide techniques and supporting documentation to assist in implementation efforts, and any criteria modified or introduced by extensions will need to be verifiable by implementers.</p>    
      </section>

      <section>
          <h3>Ensure that web pages which conform to WCAG 2.0 with an extension also conform to WCAG 2.0 on its own</h3>
          <p>Extension specifications are expected to offer modifications to existing WCAG 2.0 success criteria as well as offer additional guidelines and success criteria but Extensions may not weaken what is required of web content. The result of this is that when a page conforms to WCAG 2.0 with an extension must also conform to WCAG 2.0 if the extension is not considered in the conformance review.</p>
          <p>For example:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>An existing success criteria may change in priority from a lower level to a higher level, but not the other way around. For example, a Level A Success Criteria cannot move to Level AA.</li>
              <li>A new success criteria may be added</li>
              <li>Existing success criteria may be modified but the resulting change must still satisfy WCAG 2.0 success criteria</li>      
          </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
          <h3>Strive to make all WCAG extensions compatible with each other</h3>
          <p>Extensions should not conflict with each other, allowing authors to implement multiple extensions in order to address additional requirements for more than one user group. Group members working on different extensions should maintain good communication about extension work in progress with the Working Group and with other Task Forces writing extensions to minimize conflicts wherever possible.</p>
          <div class="note">
            <p>Please consider the requirement to make extensions compatible with each other carefully. The Working Group is concerned about whether it is possible to require full compatibility and is also concerned about the difficulty of incorporating requirements for conflicting extensions into a future guidelines update. Feedback from reviewers on this point is specifically requested.</p>
          </div>
      </section>
        
      <section>
          <h3>Define a clear conformance model for WCAG 2.0 plus extensions</h3>
          <p>The WCAG 2.0 Requirements document provides details about conformance that needs to be met for Extensions, but Extensions also need to provide conformance details that indicate the relationship of Extension conformance and WCAG 2.0 conformance. Extensions must specify that conformance claims indicate that a page conforms to WCAG 2.0 as a base and to the extension as an additional layer of conformance.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
          <h3>Ensure the conformance structure utilizes the WCAG 2.0 A/AA/AAA model</h3>
          <p>Extensions will utilize the WCAG 2.0 A/AA/AAA structure. Extensions will define additional or changed success criteria and will specify at what Level those criteria are provided. When a page conforms to an Extension at a specific level, that page must conform to WCAG 2.0 at the same level.</p>
          <p>It is important to note that changes to the level for any existing WCAG 2.0 success criteria need to be made with awareness of the implementability and testability requirements for the new level. For example, a success criteria may currently be at Level AAA as a result of very limited testability, and moving that success criteria to Level AA would require greater testability.</p>
        <section>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>A hypothetical extension is created that includes only two changes from WCAG 2.0:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Modifies an existing AA success criteria (e.g. 1.4.3 Contrast [minimum]) and moves it to level A.</li>
                <li>Adds a new guideline and two new success criteria - 5.1 at level A and 5.2 at level AA.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A web page that conforms to WCAG 2.0 AA is reviewed against the new extension following development work to make the page more accessible per the extension. In the review, it is determined that the page still meets 1.4.3, which is now a level A criteria, and the page also meets 5.1 (level A), but it does not meet 5.2 (level AA). As a result, the page could claim to conform to the WCAG 2.0 extension at level A. Without the extension, the page would be able to conform to WCAG 2.0 level AA, but with the extension the page is trying to reach more end users and the level A conformance rating provides an indication that there is more that the page can do.</p>
