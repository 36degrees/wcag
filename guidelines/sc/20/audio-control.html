   <h4>Audio Control</h4>
   
   <p class="conformance-level">A</p>
   
   <p>For any audio on a Web page that (1) plays automatically, and (2) last for more than 3 seconds, at least one of the following is true:</p>
   <dl>
      <dt>Pause or Stop</dt><dd>A mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, independently from any other audio output.</dd>
      <dt>Volume Control</dt><dd>A mechanism is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level.</dd>
   </dl>
   
   <p class="note">Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's
      ability to use the whole page, all content on the Web page (whether or not it is used
      to meet other success criteria) must meet this success criterion. See <a href="#cc5">Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference</a>.
