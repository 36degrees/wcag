    <p>Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator meets all of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Minimum area:</strong> The <a>focus indication area</a> is greater than or equal to a 1 <a>CSS pixel</a> border of the focused control.</li>
        <li><strong>Change of contrast:</strong> Color changes used to indicate focus have at least a 3:1 contrast ratio with the colors changed from the unfocused control.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjacent contrast:</strong> The focus indication area has a 3:1 contrast ratio against all adjacent colors for the minimum area or greater, or has a thickness of at least 2 CSS pixels.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">A keyboard focus indicator which has a pattern or gradient may have parts that do not meet the 3:1 contrast ratio for the change of contrast, as long as an area equal to the minimum does meet the contrast ratio.</p>
    <p class="note">If the control has a visible boundary smaller than the hit area, the size measure is taken from the visible boundary.</p>
