    <h4>Focus Appearance (Minimum)</h4>
    
    <p class="conformance-level">AA</p>
	<p class="change">New</p>
    
    <p>When a <a>user interface component</a> has keyboard focus, the focus indicator meets all the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrasting area:</strong> The focus indicator has an area with a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the colors when the component is focused and when it is not focused, and that area is at least as large as either:
        <ul>
            <li>the area of a 1 <a>CSS pixel</a> thick <a>minimum bounding box</a> around the content of the component, or</li>
            <li>the area of a 4 CSS pixel thick line along the shortest side of a <a>minimum bounding box</a> of the content of the component, and no part of the area is thinner than 2 CSS pixels.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><strong>Adjacent contrast:</strong> Where the contrasting area is adjacent to the component, it has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against the component or a thickness of at least 2 CSS pixels.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, when a component receives focus, it is not entirely hidden by author-created content.</p>
    <p>Exception: The focus indicator is defined by the user-agent and cannot be adjusted by the author.</p>
    <p class="note">The content of the component can be text or images. For blank inputs the bounding box contains the area that content would go if it were filled.</p>
    <p class="note">A keyboard focus indicator which has a pattern or gradient may have parts that do not meet the 3:1 contrast ratio for the change of contrast, as long as an area equal to the minimum does meet the contrast ratio.</p>
